## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your options by using the built-in *Options Creator* in the Arcipelago launcher.
The *Options Creator* allows customization of all the game's options and hovering over an options explain what it does.
You can read more about the options [here](en_Mortal%20Kombat%20Shaolin%20Monks.md)

* Backup your save if you want, the client removes all collected Red Koins so you can collect them while playing.

* Avoid using save states while playing, they can mess with the client's autosave and location checks.
